# Simple Blink

The action item for Simple Blink was solved in example code given by TI (explaining the copyright message before the actual code).  Due to this, the code given for both the MSP430G2553 and MPS430F5529 were taken from the TI Resource Explorer.

Both sets of code work the same way, they start off with a statement that stops the watchdog timer.  The watchdog timer is a timer integrated into the Development boards that generates a system reset if the main program doesn't interact with it.  The function is not needed for any of the action items so it is disabled for every program. The pin that controls the LED, is then set to the output direction because we want the LED to output light, it is not recieving any input.  This is done by Oring the P1 direction with the LED pin.  The program is then put into a infinite loop at which the P1OUT (the LED output) is being toggled back and forth using an XOR and there is a delay set by running a do while loop for a set number of iterations.  This is done by setting a volatile unsigned int to a number of your choosing and decrementing that number until it reaches zero. This allows for an LED to blink on and off at a constant rate.

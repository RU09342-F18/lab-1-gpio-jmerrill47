# Multiple Blink
The action item for the Multiple Blink was to blink two LEDs at completely separate frequencies. This code started from the code for Simple Blink so the same copyright message is included above the code.

The Multiple Blink program starts out the same as the Simple Blink with the disabling of the watchdog timer.  This is a functionality that isn't used so there is no reason for it run. The next step was to set the direction to output for the LED pins. This is done by ORing the P1 (or P4 for the MSP430F5529) direction with the correct bit for the pin that the LED is on. Once the directions are set, the frequency/delay was set using two volatile unsigned integers, i and j. The variable i controller the red LED frequency while j controlled the green LED frequency. The way both of these numbers were able to control the frequency was through the use of two if else statements. If the frequency number (i or j) was greater then zero, the number (i or j) would decrement. The numbers would decrement until they reached zero.  Once this happens, the LED would be toggle using an XOR and the number (i or j) would be reset to its origina value.  With this the LEDs were able to operate at completely separate frequencies from each other.
